# Generalized-Partially-Linear-Single-Index-Model
## Q. Wang, Y. Ma

* Abstract: Partially linear generalized single index models are widely used and

  have attracted much attention in the literature. However, when the

  covariates are subject to measurement error, the problem is much

  less studied. On the other hand, 

instrumental variables are important elements in studying many

errors-in-variables problems. We use the relation between

the unobservable variables and the instruments to devise consistent

estimators for partially linear generalized single index models with

binary response. We establish the consistency, asymptotic normality of

the estimator and illustrate the numerical performance of the method

through simulation studies and a data example.
